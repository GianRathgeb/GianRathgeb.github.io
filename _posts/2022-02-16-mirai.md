# Introduction

---

Mirai is rated 4.2 and is an easy box. It is a short machine and the privesc is more CTF than OSCP like but you still learn something while solving the machine. Without losing much time talking I will start with the enumeration of the box.

# Enumeration

---

I start using Nmap as always.

## Nmap Scan

---

The first thing I do is a simple scan of all ports:

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/mirai]
└─$ sudo nmap -sS  -p- mirai.htb --min-rate 1000
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-06 13:50 CEST
Nmap scan report for mirai.htb (10.10.10.48)
Host is up (0.16s latency).
Not shown: 65529 closed ports
PORT      STATE SERVICE
22/tcp    open  ssh
53/tcp    open  domain

32400/tcp open  plex
32469/tcp open  unknown

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 89.36 seconds
```

There are 6 open ports that Nmap found. On those ports I will do a deep scan using the `-A` flag):

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/mirai]
└─$ sudo nmap -A -p 22,53,80,1318,32400,32469 mirai.htb

```

I also do a UDP scan of the top 1000 ports:

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/mirai]
└─$ sudo nmap -sU mirai.htb      
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-06 14:16 CEST

5353/udp open|filtered zeroconf

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1097.33 seconds
```

There are 6 open ports too. Here is the deep scan of those open UDP ports:

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/mirai]
└─$ sudo nmap -sUV -p 53,68,123,1900,1901,5353 10.10.10.48

5353/udp open          mdns        DNS-based service discovery

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 113.17 seconds
```

I do not think that this information helps me. If I'm stuck later, I can always come back to this.

## Service Enumeration

---

SSH must not be enumerated further because there is no exploit available for this version. I leave the plex media server as well because I have not many information about it.

### Port 53 ( DNS)

---

On this port runs a DNS server (dnsmasq 2.76), I can't transfer the zone, it seems that there are none vulnerabilities in this service. There is no exploit that will lead to some sort of RCE.

### Port 1318 & 32469 (Platinum UPnP 1.0.5.13)

---

This service is also a rabbit hole, I tried some exploits but none of them worked. It might be already manually patched, tough the version is still the same.

### Port 80 (Web Server)

---

I tried to visit the webpage, but it does not work. I noticed that I can only access the webpage using the IP address. So I performed a gobuster scan:

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/mirai]
└─$ gobuster dir -u 10.10.10.48 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -o gobuster.txt -x php,html,log,txt

```

I visit the admin page, there is a control panel for a pi-hole. A possible exploit exists for this version if the path for www-data is the same as the following string: `/opt/pihole:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin`.

You can find the exploit on Github:

[GitHub - AndreyRainchik/CVE-2020-8816: A Python script to exploit CVE-2020-8816, a remote code execution vulnerability on the Pi-hole](https://github.com/AndreyRainchik/CVE-2020-8816)

# Exploitation

---

I download the exploit and try to run it without any arguments. This will show me how to use the exploit script:

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/mirai]
└─$ python3 exploit.py -h                    
usage: exploit.py [-h] url password ip port

Receive a reverse shell on a Pi-hole with access to the admin web console

positional arguments:
  url         The URL of the Pi-hole console
  password    The admin password for the Pi-hole console
  ip          The IP address for the reverse shell to connect to
  port        The port for the reverse shell to connect to

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

The script needs the administrator's password for the console as an additional parameter. So I search for the default credentials. The credentials are `pi:raspberry`. The exploit did not work so I just try the default username and password for SSH:

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/mirai]
└─$ ssh pi@10.10.10.48              
The authenticity of host '10.10.10.48 (10.10.10.48)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:UkDz3Z1kWt2O5g2GRlullQ3UY/cVIx/oXtiqLPXiXMY.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '10.10.10.48' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
pi@10.10.10.48's password: *raspberry*

---snip---

pi@raspberrypi:~ $
```

I didn't thought that this is going to work but I'm happy about it. The user pi is the only user on the system, so the flag must be in its home directory:

```bash
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd /home
pi@raspberrypi:/home $ ls
pi
```

## User Flag

---

Since the user pi is the only user on the system, I can get the user flag:

```bash
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls
background.jpg  Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  oldconffiles  python_games  Videos
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd Desktop
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $ ls
Plex  user.txt
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $ cat user.txt
ff**************************838d
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop $
```

# Privesc

---

I noticed that there is a directory called **oldconffiles**, but I could not find anything useful inside of it. The next thing I do normally is to use the `sudo -l` command:

```bash
pi@raspberrypi:~/oldconffiles/.config/pcmanfm/LXDE-pi $ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for pi on localhost:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User pi may run the following commands on localhost:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Is that a joke? I can execute all commands as sudo? Without a pssword? I use bash to test this:

```bash
pi@raspberrypi:~/oldconffiles/.config/pcmanfm/LXDE-pi $ sudo bash
root@raspberrypi:/home/pi/oldconffiles/.config/pcmanfm/LXDE-pi# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

I think that was the fastest privesc I've ever done. This can't be it, but I still try to get the root flag:

```bash
root@raspberrypi:~# ls
root.txt
root@raspberrypi:~# cat root.txt
I lost my original root.txt! I think I may have a backup on my USB stick...
```

Oh, that's what I expected, it would have been too easy. I to search for other drives like disks or USB sticks (I found a USB drive):

```bash
root@raspberrypi:~# lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0   10G  0 disk

root@raspberrypi:/media/usbstick# cat damnit.txt 
Damnit! Sorry man I accidentally deleted your files off the USB stick.
Do you know if there is any way to get them back?

-James
```

This file tells me that the root flag is deleted, but I might be able to recover it. The USB stick is located at sdb, which is in /dev/sdb. Let's check the file system (the root flag should be one of the last files, the last one is the message that james wrote):

```bash
root@raspberrypi:/tmp/testdisk# cat /dev/sdb
---snip---

     ..
       $

|}*,.+-3d**************************020b

```

The part where I put the asterisk is the root flag. That wasn’t so hard to do.

# Conclusions

---

The box in general was very easy but the part where I had to recover the root flag was tricky. It took me some moments to realize what I was supposed to do. But is was a nice challenge to boost the confidence level for the OSCP exam.
